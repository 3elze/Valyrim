#What's Valyrim?

Valyrim is a Modpack for Valheim that aims to bring back some features from Skyrim (and more!*) to the game.

Currently, this modpack only contains:

- Custom Loading Screens.

- Custom Mouse Cursor.

- Custom Sounds ( Almost all of them have been replaced. * Some sounds have been taken from Morrowind and Oblivion.





#How to install this mod: 
(TutorialVideo)


Manually: Drag and drop the extracted mod into the valheim folder, so the BepInEx folder will merge with the already present one ( if you have BepInEx already, which you SHOULD have )


Mod Organizer 2: install this mod like you'd do with any other mod. :)


Vortex: Drag 'n' Drop should work fine
